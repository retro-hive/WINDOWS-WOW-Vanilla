Bloodthirst
===========

| Bloodthirst is an instant attack skill that also adds
  an HP heal for the next 5 melee attacks (or 8 seconds).
| You can only get this skill if you take it from Fury tree.

General informations
--------------------

+ Bloodthirst cost 30 rage.
+ Bloodthirst has a 6 seconds cooldown.
+ Each heal tick will heal for 20HP, for a maximum of 100HP over 6 seconds.


Tips
----

+ At best, Bloodthirst is equivalent to 16HP5.
+ | Bloodthirst is only based on your ``AP``:
  | :math:`BT_{dmg}\ =\ AP\ \times\ 0.40`
+ This is the ability that scales the most with your gear, as it
  only depends on ``AP``, without any fixed damage amount.
+ It does not depend on your weapon. So Bloodthirst will deal the same damage
  with a dagger, sword, axe, or even two handed weapon as long as the weapon itself
  does not modify your ``AP``.
+ Having a slow 2 handed weapon might cap your ability to recover the 100HP from the buff.
