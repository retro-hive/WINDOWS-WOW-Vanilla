Whirlwind
=========

| Whirlwind is an instant attack skill that hits up to four enemy (``AoE``).

General informations
--------------------

+ Whirlwind cost 25 rage.
+ Whirlwind has a 10 seconds cooldown.
+ Whirlwind does weapon damage, without any bonus.
+ Whirlwind hits in any direction, even behind you, with a 8 miles range

Tips
----

+ This ability has normalized speed.
+ | Whirlwind does not scale much with ``AP``.
  | It depends heavily on your weapon damage.
  | Damage formula:
  | :math:`WW_{dmg}\ = Wep_{swing}\ +\ \left(AP\ \times\ \left(\frac{Wep_{speed}}{14}\right)\right)`
+ | Even if Whirlwind scales with the number of targets,
    the fact that it is an instant skill still makes it worthy to use against
    single targets, to increase your overall DPS.
+ A two handed weapon will get the best DPS boost from Whirlwind.
+ | Because it is an instant attack, it is better than ``Heroic Strike``,
    even on single targets.
