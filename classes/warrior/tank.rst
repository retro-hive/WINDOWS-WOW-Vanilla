Viability of Warrior Tanks in WoW Classic PvE Content
-----------------------------------------------------

| Warriors are the best class in Classic World of Warcraft,
  although they need a right amount of both gear and support,
  good Warriors are always able to find a group to play with
  in both PVE and PVP. Warriors can be both Melee DPS and Tanks.

| For PVE you will often see upwards of 20 Warriors in a single raid,
  this is because they take advantage of each faction's unique buffs
  to the fullest extent. As Horde, Warriors are the best class at
  abusing `Windfury Totem`_ gaining extra attacks and extra rage
  which will provide you with a significant threat boost; As Alliance,
  you get access to `Blessing of Kings`_ which makes everything just
  a bit easier, as a tank the extra agility and stamina allow you to
  transition into the popular Fury Tank spec earlier. So, whether
  you are looking to excel in PVE or PVP, you can't go wrong with Warrior.
| Warriors remain the undisputed go-to tank in Phase 5, with several new
  competitive defensive and threat generation items coming out of Ahn'Qiraj.
  While many tanks at this point will be more Fury spec than Protection
  for increased threat generation, they still fulfill the role of the
  main tank, and do so incredibly well.


Strengths of Classic Warrior Tanks
----------------------------------

Warriors scale well with gear
#############################

Out of any class in the game you won't find one
that scales anywhere near as well as Warriors,
with the right armor and an appropriate set of weapons,
they are always going to be one of the highest
performing classes in the raid.

Strong in Both PVE and PVP
##########################

As just stated, with the right gear Warriors are
capable in both PVE and PVP. If a Warrior has the
right amount of support, they can transform into
an unstoppable force.

The only "true" tank class
##########################

Although Druids and Paladins have tank specs,
Warriors are the only true tank class, and as such
they are best suited for this crucial role, even
when not specced into the protection tree Warriors
can be potent tanks.


Weaknesses of Classic Warrior Tanks
-----------------------------------

Gear dependent
##############

On the flip side of "scaling well" is being gear dependent,
if you find yourself in a world (of Warcraft) where you are
behind in gear compared to the general player base then you
aren't going to live up to a true Warrior's potential.

Requires support
################

Warriors aren't the most independent class, and in PVP
especially they are considered the worst 1v1 class, they are
extremely susceptible to being kited, they have minimal
access to crowd control abilities, and without a healer
they are quite lacking in sustain.

One of the worst levelers
#########################

Especially if you plan on leveling a Warrior solo, you are
going to have a rough time with leveling. Since Warriors
lack sustain, you will often have to eat to full life in
between just 1 or 2 mobs.


Best Race for Alliance Warrior Tanks
------------------------------------

| Human is the best Classic WoW Alliance Warrior Tank race for PvE.
  Gnome or Dwarf is the best Classic WoW Alliance Warrior Tank race For PvP.

| Alliance Warrior have the benefit of Raiding with a Paladin,
  which can Buff the raid with powerful blessings: as a protection Warrior
  you will benefit greatly from `Blessing of Kings`_, and the raid will
  be buffed with ``Blessing of Salvation`` which will greatly reduce the chance
  of you losing aggro while tanking. The strength of playing Warrior on
  Alliance comes from these buffs as it actually changes the game because
  you can count on having these buffs in raid you can gear in anticipation
  of having 10% more of your total stats.


Human Warrior
##############

Humans are, without a doubt, the best PvE Raiding Alliance Race, because of
their incredible Racials ``Sword Specialization`` and ``Mace Specialization``.
Having a higher Weapon Skill reduces the odds you will miss an attack, as well
as reduce the chance the target can block, dodge, or parry it.
Weapon Skill goes an incredibly long way in PvE content, increasing your
overall damage (and thus your threat) by a significant margin.
As for PvP, Humans are decent. Perception can increase your chance of getting
the opener versus a ``Rogue`` in the world. Of course, you can always
catch a Druid who is RÃ´dering nearby, as well.

Racial Bonuses

    | ``Diplomacy``: Reputation gains increased by 10%.
    | ``Mace Specialization``: Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
    | ``Perception``: Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
    | ``Sword Specialization``: Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
    | ``The Human Spirit``: Spirit increased by 5%.

Dwarf Warrior
#############

| Dwarves are one of the best PvP races for a Warrior.
| The Racial mostly helps against the ``Rogue`` class, ``Stoneform``
  will allow you to remove all poison effects on you, but more importantly,
  it allows the Dwarf to break out of ``Blind``, even while Blinded!
  ``Stoneform`` has other uses as well, allowing the Dwarf to remove
  Warrior Bleeds, or even an ``Undead`` ``Priest`` Class Racial,
  ``Devouring Plague``! It is instrumental to have ``Stoneform`` to remove
  damage over time effects. As for PvE Raiding, Dwarf has only minor benefits.
  ``Stoneform`` can be used in situations where you are affected by
  an appropriate debuff; you can also use it to gain 10% armor and
  be a little more durable from physical attacks.

Racial Bonuses

    | ``Find Treasure``: Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
    | ``Frost Resistance``: Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
    | ``Gun Specialization``: Guns skill increased by 5.
    | ``Stoneform``: While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

Night Elf Warrior
#######################

| Night Elf has nearly no benefits for a Warrior.
| ``Shadowmeld`` and ``Quickness`` don't do much while choosing to play
  Night Elf doesn't have much of an impact in PvE or PvP,
  Night Elves do start with the highest Agility of any of the Races,
  but this is a reasonably minor benefit.
| Compared to Dwarves, the Night Elf will always have nine more Agility,
  even in matching Gear. I would not recommend going Night Elf as a Warrior even as a tank.

Racial Bonuses

    | ``Nature Resistance``: Nature Resistance increased by 10.
    | ``Wisp Spirit``: Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
    | ``Quickness``: Dodge chance increased by 1%.
    | ``Shadowmeld``: Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

Gnome Warrior
#############

| Gnomes are considered the best Alliance PvP race for Warrior.
| One of the easiest ways to control a Warrior is to use immobilize effects,
  such as ``Forst Nova``, ``Entangling Roots``, ``Improved Hamstring``, or ``Improved Wing Clip``.
| For Warriors, it is incredibly useful to be able to free yourself
  from crowd control effects as you aren't able to deal much damage
  outside of melee range if you're interested in PVP especially Gnome
  should be a strong consideration for you.
  As for PvE Raiding, Gnome has no benefits.

Racial Bonuses

    | ``Arcane Resistance``: Arcane Resistance increased.
    | ``Expansive Mind``: Intelligence increased by 5%.
    | ``Engineering Specialization``: Engineering skill increased by 15.
    | ``Escape Artist``: Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.
