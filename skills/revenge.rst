Revenge
=======

| Revenge is a high-threat Warrior counterattack.
| It is only usable immediately after blocking, dodging, or parrying an
  attack and in Defensive Stance, making it essentially a tanking attack. 

General informations
--------------------

+ Revenge cost 5 rage points. Just like ``Overpower`` (uses same cooldown).
+ It is an instant cast.
+ Revenge does not depend on your weapon. It scales with ``attack power``.
+ You can improve Revenge (from protection tree) to add a stun effect.
+ There is a 5 seconds cooldown, nerfing its use when over-geared.
  This still is your best ``TPR`` skill.

Tips
----

+ Revenge is the ability with the highest ``TPR``.
  While Revenge is not gear dependent, triggering it is.
+ ``Shield Block`` is the best way to trigger Revenge.
+ You don't have to use Revenge on the mob that triggered it.
  You get 5 seconds to spend it on the target you want.
