Slam
====

| Slam is an ability that deals damage, based on your weapon plus an additional 87 damage.

General informations
--------------------

+ Slam cost 15 rage.
+ | It has a 1.5 second cast time.
  | This means you can't move while using it. Your target should not get too far.
+ Its damage depends on the damage range of your weapon and ``AP``.
+ You can improve its cast time to 1 second (from fury tree).


Tips
----

+ | Only use slam when using 2 handed weapons, as it is mostly based on the weapon's damage range.
  | Slam is not speed normalized. This means you want slow weapons with highest average damage (not DPS).
+ Slam having a flat 1(.5) second speed, it will greatly increase your DPS with very slow weapons.
+ | Slam is not a ``next attack`` skill.
  | Using it will pause your swing timer.
+ Slam is best used right after a white hit.
+ Slam's ``DPR`` is much higher than ``Bloodthirst``, ``Execute``, ``Heroic Strike`` or ``Cleave``.
+ Slam will do less damage than Bloodthirst when you get over 1500 ``AP``.
+ | Slam's damage formula :
  | :math:`Slam_{dmg}\ = Wep_{swing}\ +\ \left(AP\ \times\ \left(\frac{Wep_{speed}}{14}\right)\right) + 87`
